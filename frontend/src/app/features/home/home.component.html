    <h2>About the Platform</h2>
    <div class="card about-content">
      <h3>What is a DAO?</h3>
      <p>
        A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is an organization governed by smart contracts 
        and community voting. Members hold governance tokens that grant them voting rights on proposals 
        that shape the organization's future.
      </p>

      <h3>Governance Token (DGOV)</h3>
      <p>
        DGOV is the governance token that powers this DAO. Holding DGOV tokens allows you to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Vote on proposals</li>
        <li>Create new proposals</li>
        <li>Delegate voting power to others</li>
        <li>Participate in treasury decisions</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Voting Power</h3>
      <p>
        Your voting power is determined by the amount of DGOV tokens you hold. You can increase 
        your voting power by locking tokens for a specified period. Longer lock periods result 
        in greater voting power.
      </p>

      <h3>Proposals</h3>
      <p>
        Proposals are suggestions for changes or actions the DAO should take. They can include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Treasury fund allocation</li>
        <li>Protocol parameter changes</li>
        <li>Strategic decisions</li>
        <li>Community initiatives</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Once a proposal is created, it goes through a voting period where token holders can 
        vote For, Against, or Abstain. If a proposal reaches quorum and passes, it can be 
        executed on-chain.
      </p>

      <h3>Treasury</h3>
      <p>
        The DAO treasury holds the organization's funds. All treasury transactions require 
        multi-signature approval to ensure security. The community votes on how treasury 
        funds should be spent.

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <div class="card faq-content">
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h4>Do I need tokens to participate?</h4>
        <p>
          Yes, you need DGOV tokens to vote on proposals and participate in governance. 
          You can view proposals and DAO statistics without tokens.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h4>How do I get voting power?</h4>
        <p>
          Hold DGOV tokens in your wallet. You can increase your voting power by locking 
          tokens in the vote escrow contract.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h4>Can I change my vote?</h4>
        <p>
          No, once you cast a vote on a proposal, it cannot be changed. Make sure to review 
          the proposal carefully before voting.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h4>What is vote delegation?</h4>
        <p>
          Vote delegation allows you to assign your voting power to another address. This is 
          useful if you trust someone else to vote on your behalf.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h4>How long does the voting period last?</h4>
        <p>
          The voting period is set by the governance parameters. You can view the current 
          settings in the Governance section.
